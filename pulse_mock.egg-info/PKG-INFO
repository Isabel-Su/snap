# Pulse Mock API Client

A Python package for creating mock API clients using VCR cassettes that works transparently like a real REST API. Perfect for testing, development, and demos when you need predictable API responses without making real HTTP requests.

## Features

- 🎯 **Transparent API**: Works exactly like a real REST API - no manual cassette loading required
- 📼 **Automatic VCR Management**: Uses standard VCR YAML format with automatic discovery and loading
- 🚀 **Zero-Config Experience**: Just make HTTP requests - cassettes are loaded behind the scenes
- 🔍 **Smart Matching**: Automatically matches requests by method and URL with on-demand cassette loading
- 🏈 **Specialized Clients**: Built-in NFLMockClient with convenient methods for sports data
- 🌐 **REST Server**: Lightweight Flask server exposes all functionality via HTTP endpoints
- 🛡️ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for missing cassettes and unmatched requests
- 📦 **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies (PyYAML + Flask for server)

## Installation

```bash
pip install pulse-mock
```

Or for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pulse-mock.git
cd pulse-mock
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Usage - Transparent API Experience

```python
from pulse_mock import MockAPIClient

# Initialize the client - that's it! No manual cassette loading required
client = MockAPIClient()

# Make requests just like you would with any REST API
# Cassettes are automatically discovered and loaded as needed
response = client.get('http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/games/NFL_game_s7NlrGA1L1RaSOZNtJ8HHSj8')

# Access response data normally
print(response.status_code)  # 200
print(response.json())       # {'id': 'NFL_game_s7NlrGA1L1RaSOZNtJ8HHSj8', ...}

# Make another request - appropriate cassettes loaded automatically
teams_response = client.get('http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/teams')
print(f"Found {len(teams_response.json())} teams")
```

### 2. NFL Mock Client - High-Level Sports API

```python
from pulse_mock import NFLMockClient

# Specialized client with convenient methods for NFL data
client = NFLMockClient()

# Get all leagues
leagues = client.get_leagues()
print(f"Available leagues: {[league['name'] for league in leagues]}")

# Get NFL teams
teams = client.get_teams()
print(f"NFL has {len(teams)} teams")

# Find a specific team
eagles = client.find_team_by_name("Eagles")
print(f"Found: {eagles['market']} {eagles['name']}")

# Get team players
players = client.get_team_players(eagles['id'])
print(f"Eagles have {len(players)} players")

# Get quarterbacks only
qbs = client.get_players_by_position("QB", eagles['id'])
print(f"Eagles quarterbacks: {[f\"{p['first_name']} {p['last_name']}\" for p in qbs]}")
```

### 3. Auto-Loading Options

```python
from pulse_mock import MockAPIClient

# Option 1: Lazy loading (default) - cassettes loaded on-demand
client = MockAPIClient()

# Option 2: Eager loading - all cassettes loaded at startup
client = MockAPIClient(auto_load_all=True)

# Option 3: Custom cassette directory
client = MockAPIClient(cassette_dir='./my_cassettes')
```

### 4. Different HTTP Methods

```python
# All HTTP methods work transparently - no cassette loading required
client = MockAPIClient()

# Supports all standard HTTP methods
get_response = client.get('http://api.example.com/resource')
post_response = client.post('http://api.example.com/resource', headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})
put_response = client.put('http://api.example.com/resource/123')
delete_response = client.delete('http://api.example.com/resource/123')
```

### 5. Using in Tests

```python
import unittest
from pulse_mock import MockAPIClient

class TestMyAPI(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Just initialize - cassettes auto-loaded from test fixtures
        self.client = MockAPIClient(cassette_dir='tests/fixtures')
    
    def test_get_game_data(self):
        # Make request - appropriate cassette loaded automatically
        response = self.client.get('http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/games/NFL_game_s7NlrGA1L1RaSOZNtJ8HHSj8')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        
        data = response.json()
        self.assertEqual(data['id'], 'NFL_game_s7NlrGA1L1RaSOZNtJ8HHSj8')
        self.assertIn('home_team', data)
    
    def test_nfl_client_integration(self):
        from pulse_mock import NFLMockClient
        
        nfl_client = NFLMockClient()
        teams = nfl_client.get_teams()
        self.assertGreater(len(teams), 0)
        
        # Test convenience methods
        eagles = nfl_client.find_team_by_name("Eagles")
        self.assertIsNotNone(eagles)
        self.assertEqual(eagles['name'], 'Eagles')
```

## REST Server

Pulse Mock includes a lightweight REST server that exposes all the NFLMockClient functionality through HTTP endpoints. This allows you to run a mock NFL API server that other applications can interact with using standard HTTP requests.

### Starting the Server

#### Option 1: Using the provided example
```bash
# Start the server on localhost:1339
python example_nfl_server.py

# Or run with demo requests
python example_nfl_server.py --demo
```

#### Option 2: Using the module directly
```bash
# Start with default settings (localhost:1339)
python -m pulse_mock.server

# Start with custom settings
python -m pulse_mock.server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --debug
```

#### Option 3: Programmatically
```python
from pulse_mock import create_app

app = create_app()
app.run(host='localhost', port=1339, debug=True)
```

### Available Endpoints

Once the server is running, you can access these REST endpoints:

#### Server Information
- `GET /health` - Health check and server status
- `GET /v1` - API information and endpoint documentation

#### Leagues & Teams
- `GET /v1/leagues` - Get all leagues

# Get team statistics
curl http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/teams/NFL_team_ram7VKb86QoDRToIZOIN8rH/stats
```

### Using with Other Applications

The REST server makes it easy to use the mock NFL data with any application that can make HTTP requests:

```javascript
// JavaScript/Node.js
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/teams');
const teams = await response.json();
console.log(`Found ${teams.length} NFL teams`);
```

```python
# Python (using requests)
import requests
response = requests.get('http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/teams')
teams = response.json()
print(f"Found {len(teams)} NFL teams")
```

```bash
# Shell/curl
curl http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/teams | jq '.[0].name'
```

### Server Features

- 🚀 **Auto-loading**: Automatically loads all available VCR cassettes on startup
- 📡 **RESTful API**: Clean, standard REST endpoints following API conventions
- 🔍 **Search & Filter**: Built-in support for searching teams/players and filtering by position
- 📊 **Statistics**: Advanced endpoints for team statistics and analytics
- 🛡️ **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- 💾 **In-Memory**: Fast responses using in-memory data from VCR cassettes

## Why Pulse Mock?

### 🚀 **Zero-Configuration Experience**
- **Before**: Manually load cassettes, manage file paths, handle errors
- **After**: Just make HTTP requests - everything works transparently

### 🏗️ **Perfect for Development & Testing**
```python
# Replace this...
import requests
response = requests.get('http://api.example.com/data')

# With this - same interface, predictable responses
from pulse_mock import MockAPIClient
client = MockAPIClient()
response = client.get('http://api.example.com/data')
```

### 🏈 **Rich Domain-Specific APIs**
The NFLMockClient demonstrates how to build specialized clients:
- **High-level methods**: `get_teams()`, `find_player_by_name()`
- **Smart filtering**: `get_players_by_position("QB")`
- **Analytics**: `get_team_statistics()`
- **Search capabilities**: Partial name matching, team lookup

### 📈 **Scalable Architecture**
- **Lazy loading**: Handle large cassette collections efficiently
- **Smart discovery**: Automatically find relevant cassettes
- **Memory efficient**: Load only what you need, when you need it

### 🎯 **Use Cases**

1. **Integration Testing**: Test against predictable API responses
2. **Development**: Work offline with realistic data
3. **Demos & Presentations**: Consistent, reliable API responses
4. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Fast, deterministic test runs
5. **API Prototyping**: Mock future APIs before they exist

## VCR Cassette Format

Pulse Mock uses the standard VCR cassette format. Here's an example:

```yaml
---
version: 1
interactions:
- request:
    body: ""
    form: {}
    headers: {}
    url: http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/games/NFL_game_iUehba7YmVy6d5KxLnvFCgRy
    method: GET
  response:
    body: |
      {"id":"NFL_game_iUehba7YmVy6d5KxLnvFCgRy","name":"Los Angeles Chargers v Detroit Lions"}
    headers:
      Content-Length:
      - "907"
      Content-Type:
      - application/json
    status: 200 OK
    code: 200
```

## API Reference

### MockAPIClient

The main class for transparent mock API interactions using VCR cassettes.

#### Constructor

```python
MockAPIClient(cassette_dir: Optional[str] = None, auto_load_all: bool = False)
```

- `cassette_dir`: Directory containing cassette files (defaults to `cassettes/` subdirectory)
- `auto_load_all`: If `True`, automatically load all available cassettes on initialization

#### Automatic Cassette Management

The client automatically discovers and loads cassettes as needed:

- **Lazy Loading (default)**: Cassettes loaded on-demand when requests are made
- **Eager Loading**: All cassettes loaded at initialization with `auto_load_all=True`
- **Smart Discovery**: Automatically finds all `.yaml`/`.yml` files in cassette directory

#### HTTP Methods

All HTTP methods work transparently and return a `MockResponse` object:

- `get(url, headers=None, **kwargs)`
- `post(url, headers=None, **kwargs)`
- `put(url, headers=None, **kwargs)`
- `delete(url, headers=None, **kwargs)`
- `patch(url, headers=None, **kwargs)`
- `request(method, url, headers=None, **kwargs)`

#### Cassette Management Methods

While not typically needed due to automatic loading, these methods are available:

- `load_cassette(cassette_name: str)`: Load a single cassette file
- `load_cassettes(cassette_names: List[str])`: Load multiple cassette files
- `load_all_available_cassettes()`: Load all cassettes from directory
- `discover_available_cassettes()`: List available cassette files
- `clear_cassettes()`: Clear all loaded cassettes

#### Utility Methods

- `list_interactions()`: List all loaded interactions
- `auto_load_cassette_for_url(url: str)`: Attempt to auto-load cassette for specific URL

### NFLMockClient

Specialized client for NFL API data with convenient high-level methods.

#### Constructor

```python
NFLMockClient(cassette_dir: Optional[str] = None, auto_load_all: bool = True)
```

Inherits from `MockAPIClient` with eager loading enabled by default for optimal performance.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Cassette Organization

```python
# Organize cassettes by environment or feature
integration_client = MockAPIClient(cassette_dir='tests/cassettes/integration')
staging_client = MockAPIClient(cassette_dir='tests/cassettes/staging')

# Clients automatically discover and load cassettes from their respective directories
integration_response = integration_client.get('http://api.example.com/integration-endpoint')
staging_response = staging_client.get('http://api.example.com/staging-endpoint')
```

### Loading Strategies

```python
# Strategy 1: Lazy loading for large cassette collections (default)
client = MockAPIClient()  # Cassettes loaded only when needed

# Strategy 2: Eager loading for performance-critical applications
client = MockAPIClient(auto_load_all=True)  # All cassettes loaded upfront

# Strategy 3: Manual control when needed
client = MockAPIClient()
client.load_all_available_cassettes()  # Load all now
```

### Error Handling

```python
from pulse_mock import MockAPIClient, RequestNotFoundError

client = MockAPIClient()

try:
    # Request that doesn't match any cassette
    response = client.get('http://api.example.com/not-recorded')
except RequestNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Request not found in any cassettes: {e}")
    # The error message will list all loaded cassettes and interactions
```

### Debugging & Inspection

```python
client = MockAPIClient()

# Make a request to trigger auto-loading
response = client.get('http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/teams')

# Inspect what was automatically loaded
print(f"Loaded cassettes: {client.loaded_cassettes}")

# List all available interactions
interactions = client.list_interactions()
print("Available interactions:")
for interaction in interactions:
    print(f"  {interaction}")

# Discover available cassettes without loading
available = client.discover_available_cassettes()
print(f"Available cassette files: {available}")
```

### NFL Client Advanced Usage

```python
from pulse_mock import NFLMockClient

client = NFLMockClient()

# Advanced team analysis
def analyze_team(team_name):
    team = client.find_team_by_name(team_name)
    if not team:
        print(f"Team '{team_name}' not found")
        return
    
    stats = client.get_team_statistics(team['id'])
    qbs = client.get_players_by_position("QB", team['id'])
    games = client.get_team_games(team['id'])
    
    print(f"\n📊 {team['market']} {team['name']} Analysis:")
    print(f"  Total Players: {stats['total_players']}")
    print(f"  Quarterbacks: {len(qbs)}")
    print(f"  Total Games: {len(games)}")
    print(f"  QBs: {[f\"{qb['first_name']} {qb['last_name']}\" for qb in qbs[:3]]}")

# Analyze multiple teams
for team_name in ["Eagles", "Cowboys", "Giants"]:
    analyze_team(team_name)
```
